# STUDIO DRINK

Studio Drink is a full stack web application that combines two powerful remote APIs (Spotify and The Cocktail DB) with our local database, creating a site that leverages hundreds of drink recipes and millions of Spotify artists and genres. The user inputs any artist or genre on Spotify and receives a curated beverage from the connected external cocktail database. Users can create new drinks, add drinks to favorites, browse all local and external drinks, toggle alcoholic/nonalcoholic, and search drinks. The app also features an embedded Spotify player and multiple types of lazy loading including a custom pagination algorithm. Additionally, we prioritized creating a seamless and beautiful user experience with maximized customization in pure CSS (including, but not limited to: day/night mode toggle, custom side navigation, custom snackbar alerts, flip cards, and transition animations).
