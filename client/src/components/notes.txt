button onClick = handleClick

change the drinksToDisplay to only include alcohol == false drinks

in the search array that actually gets displayed
- instead of running this on the allDrinks, run it on another array that has logic to change what is being showed (if/else) depending on the toggle state

// this array would replace allDrinks in the search function 
array {
    if (alcoholic == true){
        array = [alcoholic drink array]
    } else {
        array = [nonalcoholic drink array]
    }
}

handleClick{
    // show all drinks


}



handleClick{
    show all drinks from local API with alcoholic == true
    && call the await fetchAllAlcoholicDrinks();

    show both at the same time (/lazy loading)

    show all drinks
    - but continue showing nonalcoholic drinks
    - add in alcoholic drinks 
}

- external API has an endpoint to only non-alcoholic drinks and an endpoint to alcoholic drinks
- AllDrinks page usually shows nonalcoholic drinks
